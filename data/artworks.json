      "description": "Memory is a groundbreaking artwork where a neural network trained on decades of the artist's drawing data collaborates with the artist to generate new compositions. The work visualizes the intersection of human memory, machine learning, and creative gesture—a profound meditation on how machines might 'remember' and 're-imagine' the artist's movements. Acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2022, this seminal work stands as a testament to human-machine artistic collaboration.",
      "description_zh": "《记忆》是一件突破性的艺术作品，其中在艺术家数十年绘画数据上训练的神经网络与艺术家合作生成新的构图。这件作品可视化了人类记忆、机器学习和创意手势的交汇点——对机器如何'记忆'和'重新想象'艺术家的动作的深刻思考。2022年被维多利亚和阿尔伯特博物馆收购，这件开创性作品见证了人机艺术协作的可能性。",
      "artist_statement": "This work explores the question: what does it mean for a machine to remember? By training neural networks on my drawing gestures, I'm not just creating a tool—I'm engaging in a dialogue with my own artistic practice, mediated through artificial intelligence. The result is neither purely human nor purely machine, but a genuine collaboration that reveals new possibilities in both.",
      "artist_statement_zh": "这件作品探讨了一个问题：机器'记忆'意味着什么？通过在我的绘画手势上训练神经网络，我不仅在创造一个工具——我在与我自己的艺术实践进行对话，这个对话通过人工智能来介导。结果既不是纯粹的人类创作，也不是纯粹的机器生成，而是一种真正的协作，它揭示了两者中都存在的新的可能性。",

As the artist draws, the robots simultaneously execute parallel gestures, creating a mesmerizing dialogue between human intention and mechanical precision. The work won the Excellence Award at Japan's Media Arts Festival in 2016, recognizing it as a pioneering exploration of human-machine artistic collaboration. The resulting drawings capture both the fluidity of human touch and the exactitude of mechanical reproduction.",

      "artist_statement": "With Mimicry, I wanted to ask: can machines truly collaborate with humans, or are they merely executing predetermined instructions? By designing robots that respond to my gestures in real-time, I discovered that the answer is more nuanced—the machines became collaborators that could surprise me, creating marks I never anticipated. This work is about breaking down the hierarchy between human and machine.",

The title is Latin, suggesting universality and interconnection. Rather than a static view of nature, this series captures the flow of energy, movement, and data streaming through the urban landscape. The robots, trained on both the artist's gestures and real-time urban data, become co-creators that translate the city's invisible rhythms into visible marks. Each canvas in the series—Density Study, Velocity Study, Dwell Study, Direction Study—explores different dimensions of urban life, creating a multidimensional portrait of how humans, machines, and cities are inextricably intertwined.",

      "artist_statement": "In Omnia per Omnia, I was interested in breaking the boundaries between landscape, data visualization, and performance. The city itself becomes a collaborator—its patterns of movement, its infrastructure, its invisible flows. By having robots translate these patterns into paint, I'm suggesting that the city, like any artwork, is a complex system of relationships. We are all part of this system, leaving traces that the machines help us see.",

The work draws from the surrealist 'exquisite corpse' game, but reframes it as a meditation on how different entities—human gestures, robotic responses, and natural patterns—can be folded together in unexpected ways. The title references both botanical imagery and the potential for artistic creation to contain contrasts: beauty (petal), structure (sepal), and danger (thorn). The work incorporates biofeedback data, transforming the artist's physiological responses into visual marks. What emerges is a complex tapestry where the boundary between human creativity, machine intelligence, and natural growth becomes ambiguous and permeable.",

      "artist_statement": "The Exquisite Corpus series came from wanting to explore what happens when we remove the distinction between observer and observed. By incorporating biofeedback—measuring my heart rate, breath, skin conductivity while I draw—I'm asking the machine to listen not just to my gestures but to my internal state. The result is an artwork that's literally marked by my emotions, fears, and vulnerabilities. It's a profound vulnerability, but also a profound honesty.",
